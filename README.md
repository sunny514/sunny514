### Hi there - welcome to my Github page! My name is Sunny Sharma and I’m currently enrolled in ATMS 523, Weather and Climate Data Analytics at The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I’m currently learning how to better use Python and Github. I’m looking to collaborate on cool Atmospheric Science projects! Fun fact: I currently work as a Test and Control Systems Engineer!
